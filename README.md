# power-of-two-atlas-packer

**@note** this is proof of concept, not robust code.

Atlas packing of sorted power of two quads. Using "quad path number" (???). Inspired by Hilbert curves, seems related to octree and base-4 numbers ...

**@TODO:** It is not general in a sense that if there is a texture of 256x256 in atlas of 256x256 then quad number won't work on it, because it starts with texture split into quads.
